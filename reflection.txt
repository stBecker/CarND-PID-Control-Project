1. Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

The proportional component's responsibility is to quickly reduce the CTE. A large value leads to a quick adjustion, 
but will also result in a large overshoot.
The integral component has the job of eliminating any systematic biases to the goal line. For this project it was not
very important, because there was no or only a sufficiently small bias and the curvature of the track made frequent
adjustments necessary anyway.
The derivative component is used to reduce the overshoot and stabilize the vehicle.


2. Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The parameters were chosen by manual tuning. Starting with Ki = 0 and Kd = 0, the Kp was adjusted until a sufficient
correction velocity with limited overshooting had been observed. Then Kd was increased to reduce the overshoot. Ultimately
Ki was set to a small value, but turned out not to be very important.
